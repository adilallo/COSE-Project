      .com browser. We dissect and then regroup the visual elements that are provided

      filters are sorting gestures such as: taking apart, isolating, staging, counting,
      labeling, marking, focusing, creating explanatory models as shortcuts of certain

      the dominant colour corresponded to less space available for other elements.
      For example, if white emerges as the dominant colour, it indicates a significant
      portion of the screen is taken by the background, necessitating other elements
      to cluster in the remaining space. Similarly, a substantial percentage of black
      and grey was considered to indicate clustering, as black only appears when
      elements overlap or when formatted-text fields are densely layered. The text
      within the HTML field did not significantly influence the black ratio and,
      therefore, had minimal impact on the value. Grey, on the other hand, mainly
      emerges as an ephemeral field during the loading process of a new page and
      does not convey any discernible information. In most cases, the clustering
      factor resulted from the combination of white, black, and occasionally grey.
