      .com browser. We dissect and then regroup the visual elements that are provided
      in the viewport of the monitor. Taking everything apart first and reassembling
      it later in different constellations, helps us to determine how or whether
      elements cluster dynamically in terms of space and (inter)activity. This room
      offers filters that suggest ways to see order in the browser output. These
      filters are sorting gestures such as: taking apart, isolating, staging, counting,
      labeling, marking, focusing, creating explanatory models as shortcuts of certain
      underlying \u2018mechanisms\u2019. We learn about the rules of the visual layers
      within the artwork and come to unexpected conclusions. Let\u2019s go!\r\n\r\nOur
      argumentation is a journey. It includes nine hypotheses and four main tactical
      moves. Within each move you can collect three take home messages. Watch out
