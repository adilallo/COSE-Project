    m_Localized: "This room looks analytically at the visual output of JODI\u2019s
      .com browser. We dissect and then regroup the visual elements that are provided
      in the viewport of the monitor. Taking everything apart first and reassembling
      it later in different constellations, helps us to determine how or whether
      elements cluster dynamically in terms of space and (inter)activity. This room
      offers filters that suggest ways to see order in the browser output. These
      filters are sorting gestures such as: taking apart, isolating, staging, counting,
      labeling, marking, focusing, creating explanatory models as shortcuts of certain
      underlying \u2018mechanisms\u2019. We learn about the rules of the visual layers
      within the artwork and come to unexpected conclusions. Let\u2019s go!\r\n\r\nOur
      argumentation is a journey. It includes nine hypotheses and four main tactical
      moves. Within each move you can collect three take home messages. Watch out
      for them, you might need them later. Our journey begins now!\r"

    m_Localized: 'Clarity is useful to determine which visual elements exist in this
      browser. The following inventory of the different types of elements that you
      may encounter in this browser is already ordered in a specific way, namely
      how they overlap each other. Overlapping suggests depth and we show a layering
      structure based on the visual element types (not their size, not their time
      of appearance; later on, their colour will play a role). Learn about the GUI
      elements!

    m_Localized: "Some math: so far we have encountered 18 element types, and exemplified
      them with the red tab. But there are four more tabs. Taking some singular elements
      apart, and considering that some elements multiply over time, we have at least
      66 elements permanently present plus some ephemeral ones. That\u2019s a lot!
      It\u2019s easy to lose track of them. Moreover, there is a certain variance
      in how much presents itself to the users\u2019 eye in the browser as a whole.\n\nBut
      some elements have bonds, they act as a cluster. By interacting with them,
      we can test the linkages and affordances of the elements."

      the websites are actually presented. Does this artwork show us the \u2018backside\u2019

      of several elements. So let\u2019s meet these four complex protagonists in
      their full three-dimensionality!\n\nIn the .com browser, one website is depicted
      within a tab field complex. As the tab field complex is a mix of buttons, texts
      and colour fields, its configuration has much depth. This stretched-out three-dimensionality
      is an important factor as soon as further tab field complexes enter the scene."
